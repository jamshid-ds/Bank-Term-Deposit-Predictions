# Bank-Term-Deposit-Predictions-
In this project, using the dataset created in the Bank's data, predicting the giving of a term deposit to the Client was carried out
<br>
<br>
<br>
**The main thing we need to say is that there are no nan values in the dataset, which makes it much easier for us to process the dataset.**
<br>
<br>
<br>
**First of all, we planned what we had to do**
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Step-1**: Data collection and understanding
<br>

**Step-2**: The visualization part. Graphics used:
<br>

**Step-3**:Preparing the dataset for Machine Learning
<br>

**Step-4**: Machine Learning
<br>

**Step-5**: Model evaluation
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
**we got a lot of conclusions with the help of visualization. Let's get to know them**

<br>**This is the information we can conclude from the table**:
<br>The main customers are between 30-35 years old
<br>The minimum age of the customers started from 18 years old on average

<br>**This is the information we can conclude from the table**:
<br>There are relatively more blue-collar workers in the table (blue-collar workers).

<br>**Our main table**
<br>**This is the information we can conclude from the table**:
<br>Unverified customers far outnumber verified ones. ( 88.3% | 11.7% )
<br>
<br>
<br>
**We tested many machine learning algorithms, two of them: Random Forest and Decision Tree Algorithms gave good results**
